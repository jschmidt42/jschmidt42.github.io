### New site!

I am porting my old site to this new github.io blogging platform.

### Skip Traffic Jams

I wrote that little web site in order to be alerted when traffic on a certain route is over.

_If I complain about a traffic jam, I have no one to blame but myself. -- Steve Wynn_

Leaving your home to find yourself jammed in traffic a few minutes later is always frustrating. 
What this web application propose is instead of always leaving at the same hour for work, if you 
can, will send you some message alerting you that the rush hour is over and that the route is 
clear to get quickly at your destination without worrying about being jammed in traffic. 
Skipping traffic each day will make you happier.
